# Project instructions

## Task Observer activation

Before the first tool call of any session — and before writing or
proposing a plan, not merely before executing one — invoke the
task-observer skill AND execute its Session Start Protocol (storage
check, frontmatter scan, review trigger). Loading the skill and running
the protocol are separate steps; a session that loads the file and stops
has activated nothing. Any turn that will involve a tool call counts; do
not classify the session as "too simple" from its opening message.

After completing each task, check the observation records written this
session and report a one-line summary (ids and titles, or "none logged
and why"). This is the activation backstop: it forces a look at the log,
so a session that silently skipped the protocol is discovered at the
first task boundary instead of never.

When loading any skill, check the observation log for OPEN observations
tagged to that skill. Apply their insights to the current work, even if
the skill file hasn't been updated yet.

The observation log for this project lives at:
  /Users/pranay/Projects/Experiments/data-recovery/skill-observations/observation-log/
Use that path. Never resolve the workspace from the current working
directory — a cwd inside an ephemeral checkout (a git worktree, a temporary
clone) is torn down and takes the log with it. Never place the workspace
inside a skills-discovery directory or any path linked into one. If this
environment mints a separate project identity per checkout, or more than
one agent works this project, the pinned path above is the single shared
location; do not derive one per session, tool or project.
